# android_modularization
This is a simple application that uses Multi-modular architecture. It fetches data from a api and displays it in a lazy column.
It has two screens, the main screen, that shows the list of blogs and details, that just shows details of a single blog.
It is a good introduction to understanding how to create multi-module apps and how to handle dependecies using a version catalog file 
and how to divide the architecture into Presenatation, Domain and Data layers.
I also implement paging and caching using Room.
